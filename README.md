# Automatic-Question-Generator-with-NLP
This is my final-year BE Project. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), question generation (QG) is a well-known task that generates understandable questions from an input text. There are many valuable applications in  AQG, especially in educational settings, to create quizzes or reading comprehension papers.

The workings and flow of the project are given in the report provided.

## An overview of the entire project is given below in a poster.
